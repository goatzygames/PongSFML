About the Project

This project was developed purely for **educational purposes**.  
It helped me learn about:
- The SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- Game states (menu, difficulty select, gameplay)
- Handling input, collisions, and frame timing
- Implementing sound, animations, and difficulty settings

While this isn’t part of my main portfolio, I plan to use what I’ve learned here to create more advanced SFML projects in the future.
